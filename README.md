## General Information

1. Lending Club is Consumer Finance Company which provide loans to different segment of urban society according to their needs and wants.
2. When company receive the loan application, it goes through screening to check if loan can be given to customer or not based on applicantâ€™s profile.
3. Two types of risk are associated with it to make decision:
	a. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
 	b. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
4. The company aims to identify the key factors influencing customer behavior to determine which customers are at risk of defaulting and which are likely to remain loyal.



## Conclusions

1. Lending Club should consider refraining from approving loans for customers seeking loan consolidation, as they are more likely to default. The purpose of the loan should be carefully evaluated.
2. Borrowers are taking loans for 60 months are 20% more getting defaulted since small amount loans are more their term should be less.
3. Higher interest rates for certain purposes, such as small business loans, tend to attract more defaulters. Lending Club should consider lowering interest rates for such cases to reduce default risk.
4. Defaulting customers with lower annual incomes are taking out larger loans. Lending Club should implement an upper limit on loan amounts based on the borrower's income.
5. Borrowers with lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios are less likely to default.
6. LC should review a borrower's open credit lines before approving a new loan. Apart from mortgages, borrowers typically maintain 3 to 4 active credit lines.
